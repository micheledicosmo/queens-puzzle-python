A (potentially buggy and incomplete) Python solver for the [Queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) for students to gain experience with OOP and Unit Testing.

Translated from the preliminary and simplified Java version available at [University of Udine - OOP course website](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~claudio.mirolo/teaching/prog_oo/) under the section *alcuni esempi*.

A few unit tests are available for the class **Board**.

The file `UML_classes.svg` contains an *imprecise* representation of the code.
